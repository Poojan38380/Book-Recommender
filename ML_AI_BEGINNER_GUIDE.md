# 📘 Book Recommender – AI & ML Explained *(Zero-Jargon Guide)*

> **Goal of this guide** — Help a non-technical teammate clearly explain *what the “brain” of our app does*, from raw data to final suggestions, using everyday language and analogies.

## 1  Starting Point: Our Library of Books
Imagine a huge bookshelf (the **dataset**) that lists ~11 000 books.  
For each book we know:
- Title & Author (words)  
- Average 1-to-5 star rating (number)  
- How many people rated it (popularity)  
- Language (e.g. English, Spanish)  
- Year published, page count, etc.

Think of this spreadsheet as **ingredients** we will later bake into “taste fingerprints”.

## 2  Turning Books into “Taste Fingerprints”
Humans compare books by genre, vibe, author style…  
Computers need **numbers**. We therefore create a **fingerprint** (a list of ~30 numbers) for each book.

### How do we get those numbers?
| Idea (Analogy) | Real Feature | Why it helps |
|---|---|---|
| How sweet is a dessert? | ⭐ Average rating (scaled 0-1) | Good books > Bad books |
| Dessert popularity | Log of ratings count | Crowd favourites |
| Country cuisine | One-hot language codes | Language similarity |
| Recipe age | Year normalised | Classic vs modern tone |
| Chef’s fame | Author popularity score | Same-author flavour |
| Taste mood | **Sentiment score** from simple text analysis | Light-hearted vs dark |

All features are squeezed to **0-1 range** (like converting °C to %).  
Now every book is a point in a 30-dimensional “taste space”.

👉 **Analogy:** Each book is now a *star in the sky*; books with similar flavours are *close together*.

## 3  Teaching the Computer to Find Neighbours
We use a very simple algorithm called **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)**.  
It does not *learn* complex rules; it simply stores every star’s coordinates.

1. When a user asks for “books like *Dune*”, we find *Dune’s* coordinates.  
2. We measure the angle between stars (called **cosine distance**).  
   • Small angle = books talk about similar themes.  
3. We pick the **10 closest stars** (the neighbours).  
4. We convert distance to **similarity %** (so closer = higher %).

👉 **Analogy:** Lost in a new city? You stand at one address (book) and look for the 10 closest cafés (similar books) on a map.

## 4  Mini Brain for Book Mood – Sentiment Model
We also built a tiny side-model that can read short reviews and guess if the feeling is *positive* or *negative* (like a movie critic that just says “👍 or 👎”).
- It’s a *bag-of-words* trick: counts happy vs sad words.
- Accuracy isn’t perfect (< 1 sec to train), but it gives an extra flavour dimension.

This score becomes one of the 30 fingerprint numbers.

## 5  Putting It All Together – The Daily Workflow
1. **Startup (first time)** – read CSV → build fingerprints → store all stars → save to disk (takes < 1 minute).  
2. **Future restarts** – simply reload saved stars (2 seconds).  
3. **Serving a request** – lookup neighbours in memory (few milliseconds) → send JSON back to frontend.

No heavy GPU, no internet. Runs on an average laptop.

---

## 6  Why This Approach Works
- **Explainable** – we can show *exactly* why two books are close (e.g. same author and language, both highly-rated).  
- **Cold-start proof** – new books need only metadata, no user history.  
- **Fast & light** – KNN search on 11 k points is trivial.

---

## 7  Limitations
- Doesn’t understand deep plot themes like a large language model would.  
- Popularity bias – famous authors may overshadow hidden gems.  
- Sentiment model is toy-sized; real reviews would need bigger NLP.

---

## 8  Future Superpowers (Roadmap)
1. Replace simple sentiment with **GPT-generated embeddings** for richer mood vectors.  
2. Combine with **user behaviour** (collaborative filtering) to personalise.  
3. Use **Approximate Nearest Neighbour** libraries (FAISS) for millions of books.

## 9  One-Slide Pitch for Presenters
> “We turn every book into a 30-number fingerprint that captures ratings, popularity, language, author fame, era and mood.  A simple map (KNN) finds the books standing closest to any given title.  The whole brain lives in memory, answers in milliseconds, and retrains in under a minute – all with plain Python, no GPUs.”

👏 **That’s it!** You can now explain the AI inside our Book-Recommender to any audience.
