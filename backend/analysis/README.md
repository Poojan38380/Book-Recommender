# Analysis Directory

This directory contains the original analysis and experimental code from the book recommendation system.

## Files

- `original_recommender.py` - The original 604-line recommender file that contained:
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Data visualization code
  - Sentiment analysis training
  - Multiple clustering approaches
  - KNN recommendation implementation
  - Mixed analysis and production code

## Why This Was Moved

The original file was difficult to maintain and edit because:
1. **Mixed concerns** - Analysis code mixed with production logic
2. **Large file size** - 604 lines made it hard for LLMs to process
3. **Poor modularity** - Everything was in one monolithic file
4. **Hardcoded paths** - Kaggle-specific file paths
5. **Visualization dependencies** - Matplotlib/seaborn code in production

## New Modular Structure

The functionality has been refactored into clean, focused modules:

### Production Modules (in `backend/`)
- `data_loader.py` - Clean data loading and preprocessing
- `feature_engineering.py` - Feature creation and scaling
- `sentiment_analysis.py` - Sentiment model training and inference  
- `recommendation_engine.py` - Core KNN recommendation engine
- `genre_recommender.py` - Genre-based recommendation interface
- `main.py` - FastAPI server with clean endpoints

### Benefits of Refactoring
1. **Maintainable** - Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Testable** - Individual components can be tested separately
3. **Editable** - LLMs can easily understand and modify focused modules
4. **Scalable** - New features can be added without affecting existing code
5. **Production-ready** - Clean separation of analysis and serving code

## Usage

For analysis and experimentation, you can still reference the original code in `original_recommender.py`.

For production use, import from the new modular structure:

```python
from genre_recommender import recommend_books

# Get recommendations
books = recommend_books("fantasy", n_recommendations=5)
```
